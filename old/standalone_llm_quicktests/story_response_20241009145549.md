1) Interpretation of the story:

The story revolves around a tense and crucial moment in a football match between two rival teams, San Rafael United and Riverwood FC. Diego "The Hammer" Torres, a key player for San Rafael, scores a stunning equalizer with a free kick, bringing his team back into the game. However, the momentum shifts again when Riverwood's star striker, Kofi Mensah, wins a penalty for his team, which could potentially seal the victory for Riverwood. The story highlights the emotional highs and lows experienced by the players, especially Diego and his best friend, Carlos Gomez, who is forced to watch from the sidelines due to an injury.

2) Prediction of what will happen next:

Given the intensity and unpredictability of the match so far, it's difficult to predict the exact outcome. However, considering the context, here are a few possibilities:

a) Kofi Mensah scores the penalty, securing a 2-1 lead for Riverwood FC and potentially ending San Rafael's hopes of winning the match.

b) The San Rafael goalkeeper makes an incredible save, denying Kofi the penalty goal and keeping the score tied at 1-1. This could lead to extra time or even a penalty shootout to decide the winner.

c) The referee changes his mind about the penalty call after consulting with the assistant referee or reviewing the play on the stadium's screen, realizing that Luis did indeed get the ball first. This would allow San Rafael to maintain possession and continue their push for a winning goal.

d) As Kofi prepares to take the penalty, the San Rafael players try to distract him, or the crowd creates a hostile atmosphere, affecting his focus and causing him to miss the penalty. This could give San Rafael a chance to regroup and find a way to score the winning goal.
